  abstract  = {Irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems (IPHS) have recently been proposed for the modelling of irreversible thermodynamic systems. On the other hand, a classical result on the use of the second law of thermodynamics for the stabilization of irreversible processes is the celebrated thermodynamic availability function. These frameworks are combined to propose a class of Passivity Based Controller (PBC) for irreversible processes. An alternative formulation of the availability function in terms of internal energy is proposed. Using IPHS a matching-condition, which is interpreted in terms of energy-shaping, is derived and a specific solution that permits to assign a desired closed-loop structure and entropy rate is proposed. The approach can be compared with Interconnection and Damping Assignment-PBC, this method however leads in general to thermodynamically non-coherent closed-loop systems. In this paper a system theoretic approach is employed to derive a constructive method for the control design. The closed-loop system is in IPHS form, hence it can be identified with a thermodynamic system and the control parameters related with thermodynamic variables, such as the reaction rates in the case of chemical reactions. A generic non-linear non-isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor is used to illustrate the approach.},

This paper deals with the power controller design of a SMES unit with an optimal coil size for stabilization of an isolated microgrid. The study microgrid consists of renewable energy sources with intermittent power outputs i.e., wind and photovoltaic. Since power generations from such renewable sources are unpredictable and variable, these result in power fluctuations in a microgrid. To stabilize power fluctuations, a SMES unit with a fast control of active and reactive power can be applied. The structure of a power controller is the practical proportional-integral (PI). Based on the minimization of the variance of power fluctuations from renewable sources as well as the initial stored energy of SMES, the optimal PI parameters and coil size are automatically and simultaneously tuned by a particle swarm optimization. Simulation studies show that the proposed SMES controller with an optimal coil size is able to effectively alleviate power fluctuations under various power patterns from intermittent renewable sources. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the operating characteristics of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) for the frequency control of an islanded microgrid operation. In the grid-connected mode of a microgrid, an imbalance between power supply and demand is solved by a power trade with the upstream power grid. The difference in the islanded mode is a critical problem because the microgrid is isolated from any power grid. For this reason, the frequency control during islanded microgrid operation is a challenging issue. A test microgrid in this paper consisted of a wind power generator, a PV generation system, a diesel generator and a load to test the feasibility of the SMES for controlling frequency during islanded operation as well as the transient state varying from the grid-connected mode to the islanded mode. The results show that the SMES contributes well for frequency control in the islanded operation. In addition, a dual and a single magnet type of SMES have been compared to demonstrate the control performance. The dual magnet has the same energy capacity as the single magnet, but there are two superconducting coils and each coil has half inductance of the single magnet. The effectiveness of the SMES application with the simulation results is discussed in detail.},

  abstract  = {Recently, automotive original equipment manufacturers have focused their efforts on developing greener propulsion solutions in order to meet the societal demand and ecological need for clean transportation, so the development of new energy vehicle (NEV) has become a consensus among governments and automotive enterprises. Efficient electrical energy storage system (EESS) appears to be very promising for meeting the rapidly increased requirements of vehicular applications. It is necessary to understand performances of electrical energy storage technologies. Therefore, this paper reviews the various electrical energy storage technologies and their latest applications in vehicle, such as battery energy storage (BES), superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), flywheel energy storage (FES), ultra-capacitor (UC) energy storage (UCES) and hybrid energy storage (HES). The research priorities and difficulties of each electrical energy storage technology are also presented and compared. Afterwards, the key technologies of EESS design for vehicles are presented. In addition, several conventional EESSs for vehicle applications are also analyzed; the comparison on advantages and disadvantages of various conventional EESSs is highlighted. From the rigorous review, it is observed that almost all current conventional EESSs for vehicles cannot meet a high-efficiency of power flow over the full operation range; optimization of EESS and improved control strategies will become an important research topic. Finally, this paper especially focuses on a type of linear engine, a brand new automotive propulsion system used for NEV; the guiding principle of EESS design for the new type of linear engine is proposed, an overview of a novel hybrid EESS based on hybrid power source and series-parallel switchover of UC with high efficiency under wide power flow range for the type of linear engine is presented, and advanced features of the novel hybrid EESS are highlighted.},

  abstract  = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous technoeconomic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead-acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni-Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

  abstract = {Passivity-based control is widely used in electronic circuit systems because it can utilize their internal structures to facilitate the controller design. In this paper, we first propose a dissipative Hamiltonian realization of power systems and discuss the disadvantages of the traditional passivity-based excitation controller. Then, a novel excitation controller is put forward to reassign the interconnection and dissipative matrix, and the corresponding Hamiltonian function. Simulation results verify that the proposed controller can effectively improve the transient stability of the power system.},

  abstract = {In this work, a PSCAD electromagnetic model is constructed for a microgrid community. It consists of three microgrids networked through the medium voltage (MV) distribution system as a practical case of the distributed resource island systems of IEEE Standard 1547.4. Typical operational scenarios are then simulated for both grid connected and islanded mode of operation. The study outcomes demonstrate the operational feasibility of networked microgrids in electrical distribution systems and the effectiveness of common droop controls in facilitating energy transaction of the microgrids and maintaining voltage and frequency stabilities under normal network disturbances. This investigation is significant in that it addresses the needs and issues arising from primary controls for facilitating the energy transactions of secondary and tertiary controls in the hierarchical control strategy of networked microgrids in the MV distribution system. Future studies of the secondary and tertiary control algorithms will need to incorporate new requirements for ensuring distribution system voltage and frequency securities.},

Hybrid ES system (HESS) control is normally realized with centralized coordination. In this paper, HESS distributed control, which is independent of the communication link, is proposed to enhance system reliability. All ESs are configured as slack terminals to reg-ulate system bus voltage with droop control. System net power decomposition and ESs power sharing are realized with local-ized low-pass filter (LPF) applied to ESs with low-ramp rates. The relationship between LPF cut-off frequency and ES ramp rate is elaborated in detail. However, bus voltage deviation and power tracking errors are the main drawbacks of HESS dis-tributed control. Multilevel energy management system (EMS) is thus proposed to enhance system control accuracy. HESS dis-tributed control is scheduled as the primary control. Bus voltage restoration and power sharing compensation are applied in sec-ondary control to eliminate the voltage deviation and power tracking errors, respectively. In tertiary control, autonomous state of charge (SoC) recovery is implemented to limit SoC variation of ES with high-ramp rate. A lab-scale dc microgrid is developed to verify the proposed multilevel EMS for HESS control.},

In this paper, hierarchical control of HESS, comprised of both centralized and distributed control, is proposed to enhance system reliability. The conventional HESS centralized control is refined with implementations of online iteration, secondary voltage regulation and autonomous state of charge (SoC) recovery. ESs power references are generated iteratively to maximize the utilizations of ESs ramp rates and power capacities. Secondary voltage regulation and autonomous SoC recovery are applied to minimize bus voltage deviation and limit slack terminal SoC variation, respectively. In case of communication failure, a novel algorithm for HESS distributed control is proposed to retain system operation. Bus voltage is regarded as the global indicator for system power balance and droop relationships are imposed for ESs control. System net power decomposition and ESs power dispatch are realized with localized LPFs. SoC recovery in distributed control is implemented by tuning the threshold voltage of slack terminal.

Until now the most used configuration has been the ac microgrid, but dc-based microgrids are gaining interest due to the advantages they provide over their counterpart (no reactive power, no synchronization, increasing number of dc devices, etc.). Therefore, hybrid ac/dc microgrids are raising as an optimal approach as they combine the main advantages of ac and dc microgrids. This paper reviews the most interesting topologies of hybrid ac/dc microgrids based on the interconnection of the ac and dc networks and the conventional power network. After performing a description and analysis of each configuration, a comparative evaluation has been performed to highlight the most important features of each one. The future trends identified during the study also show that several features such as the scalability, modeling or design require further research towards the integration of hybrid microgrids in the power network.},

We propose a detail modelling for microturbines (MTs) and fuel cells (FCs), where the constraints associated with such factors as the ramps, minimum up and downtime, and generation limits, represent various peculiarities that have not been adequately considered in literature. The proposed model also considers a detailed representation of critical, reschedulable and curtailable loads, which are important aspects in the MG concept. To analyse the proposed modelling, a MG is used along with a MT, a FC, a battery bank, wind and photovoltaic generators connected to the main grid.

In response to UCSD's expressed financial interest, we assess three strategies for integrating renewable generation: peak load shifting, onsite photovoltaic firming and grid support. While all three strategies are technically feasible and can be cost-effective under certain conditions, California's current tariff structures and market prices do not offer sufficient incentives to motivate UCSD to offer these services. Alternative incentive mechanisms, which may resemble to those used to encourage renewable generation development, are necessary to induce UCSD's DER offer for renewables integration.

  abstract = {DC microgrids (MGs) have gained research interest during the recent years because of many potential advantages as compared to the ac system. To ensure reliable operation of a low-voltage dc MG as well as its intelligent operation with the other DC MGs, a hierarchical control is proposed in this paper. In this hierarchy, primary control level is used to regulate the common bus voltage inside each MG locally. A voltage secondary control (VSC) is designed to eliminate the dc bus voltage deviation produced by primary level while guarantees proper operation of tertiary level. This secondary control acts not only as a central controller for the each MG individually, but also as a decentralized controller when dc MGs are connected together. This way, VSC maintains the dc bus voltage around the voltage reference using an averaging method. This allows the power flow control to be achieved at the same time since it can be accomplished only at the cost of having the voltage deviation inside the system. Neighboring communication is employed to exchange the voltage output of MGs to the neighbors using low bandwidth communication (LBC) network. Finally, a power flow control (PFC) is proposed to control the tie-line current between the MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through detailed hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations.},

  abstract = {Frequency control in autonomous microgrids (MG) with high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) represents a great concern to ensure the system stability. In this regard, the paper presents an enhanced control method for battery energy storage systems (BESS) to support the frequency of MG and with the ability of disconnecting from the MG to supplying in island mode a local consumer. A frequency controller, combining a conventional droop control with an inertia emulation function, governs the BESS active power transfer during the primary frequency control level. The BESS may also provide voltage support in the point of common coupling with the MG. Moreover, the proposed BESS may compensate, partially or totally, the power absorbed by the local loads in order to improve the MG frequency response. When the MG power quality worsens below a certain level, in terms of voltage and frequency, the BESS detaches from the MG and continues to operate islanded. The reconnection is accomplished following a smoothly resynchronization of the local voltage with the MG, without disturbing the local loads supply. Additionally, the paper also discusses about aspects related with the BESS management and its integration within the proposed system. Simulation and experimental results assess the feasibility of the proposed control solutions.},

Each of these controllers includes a selective virtual impedance loop which is considered to improve sharing of fundamental and harmonic components of load current among the DG units. The sharing improvement is provided at the expense of increasing voltage unbalance and harmonic distortion. Thus, the secondary control level is applied to manage the compensation of SLB voltage unbalance and harmonics by sending proper control signals to the primary level. DGs compensation efforts are controlled locally at the primary level. The system design procedure for selecting proper control parameters is discussed.

When designing an LV DC microgrid protection system, knowledge from existing DC power systems can be used. However, in most cases, these systems use grid-connected rectifiers with current-limiting capability during DC faults. In contrast, an LV DC microgrid must be connected to an AC grid through converters with bidirectional power flow and, therefore, a different protection-system design is needed. In this paper, the operating principles and technical data of LV DC protection devices, both available and in the research stage, are presented. Furthermore, different fault-detection and grounding methods are discussed. The influence of the selected protection devices and grounding method on an LV DC microgrid is studied through simulations. The results show that it is possible to use available devices to protect such a system. Problems may arise with high-impedance ground faults which can be difficult to detect.},

The main potential for a low cost operation and uninterrupted power supply lies in the optimal sizing and operation of such microgrids. In particular, sudden variations in load demand or in the power supply from renewables underline the need for an optimally sized system. This paper presents an efficient multi-objective model based optimization approach for the optimal sizing of all components and the determination of the best power electronic layout. The presented method is divided into three optimization problems to minimize economic and environmental objectives. This design optimization includes detailed components models and an optimized energy dispatch strategy which enables the optimal design of the energy system with respect to an adequate control for the specific configuration. To significantly reduce the computation time without loss of accuracy, the presented method contains the determination of a representative load profile using a k-means clustering method. The k-means algorithm itself is embedded in an optimization problem for the calculation of the optimal number of clusters. The benefits in term of reduced computation time, inclusion of optimal energy dispatch and optimization of power electronic architecture, of the presented optimization method are illustrated using a case study.},

This generation concept would permit to form local networks, microgrids, when the main grid falls due to any kind of contingency in the network. However, the connection and disconnection of these local networks may give rise to undesired transient overcurrents that should be avoided. In order to solve this drawback, this paper presents a method oriented to carry out a stable intentional disconnection/reconnection of local grids from the main electrical network under grid-fault conditions. This control method has been implemented in a grid-connected power converter that acts as an intelligent connection agent (ICA) and adapts its operation mode according to its connection state. The proposed control also manages the operation of a controlled switch, which is responsible of disconnecting/reconnecting the microgrid from the mains. In this paper, the behavior of the ICA under transient conditions will be discussed, and finally, its simulated and experimental performance will be shown.},

To support the normal operation of distributed renewable energy and feed the critical loads under the isolated mode, the BESS generally works in voltage control mode (VCM). The proposed control strategy, which transforms the tracking control problem into a state feedback control problem, includes two terms, one of which is state feedback control used to stabilize system while another employs multiple resonant controllers applied to achieve harmonics compensation control. The optimal linear-quadratic (LQ) control approach in which the root locus method is used for optimization selection of weight matrix Q is adopted to tune the control parameters of multiple resonant controllers. The proposed control strategy performs outstanding voltage control performance to maintain an excellent voltage level such as zero steady-state error and low total harmonic distortion (THD) under the situation of sudden load changes, back power flow of renewable energy such as photovoltaic and nonlinear load in an isolated microgrid. Finally, the validity of the proposed approach is verified through simulations and a three-phase experiment prototype of BESS with TMS320F28335 DSP.},

Aiming to do so, different control strategies were developed and tested: (1) a local control approach where no communication link is required and (2) a centralized charging control solution. The local control approach is based on the measuring of EV terminal voltage and frequency in order to define the charging or discharging rates of the batteries. The centralized control strategy allows balancing single-phase loads connected to the microgrid by adapting the charging rates of the EV storage devices. Simulation results show that EV batteries can actively contribute for voltage balancing and frequency control during islanding operating conditions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Islanding is the situation in which part of the power grid, consisting of load and distributed generation (DG) is isolated from the utility grid remaining active, i.e. serving load. The idea of islanding parts of the distribution network in case of faults, in order to increase the consumer quality of service, is the basic notion behind the formation of Microgrids. In the context of Microgrids, it becomes necessary to distinguish between intended islanding e.g. due to maintenance and unintended islanding due to faults at the upstream grid. When the emergency situation ceases, the Microgrid should reconnect seamlessly to the upper grid. In this paper, an islanding detection method (IDM) is proposed that is based on the insertion of a suitable, variable impedance at the low voltage side of the Grid. Islanding detection is effected by an intelligent agent embedded into the Microgrid's Central switch, which is transformed to a hybrid automatic transfer switch (HATS). The HATS agent detects the operation mode of the Microgrid based on local measurements and supervises the grid status. Both simulation studies and hardware laboratory tests are presented showing the performance and feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {A cooperative distributed secondary/primary control paradigm for AC microgrids is proposed. This solution replaces the centralized secondary control and the primary-level droop mechanism of each inverter with three separate regulators: voltage, reactive power, and active power regulators. A sparse communication network is spanned across the microgrid to facilitate limited data exchange among inverter controllers. Each controller processes its local and neighbors' information to update its voltage magnitude and frequency (or, equivalently, phase angle) set points. A voltage estimator finds the average voltage across the microgrid, which is then compared to the rated voltage to produce the first voltage correction term. The reactive power regulator at each inverter compares its normalized reactive power with those of its neighbors, and the difference is fed to a subsequent PI controller that generates the second voltage correction term. The controller adds the voltage correction terms to the microgrid rated voltage (provided by the tertiary control) to generate the local voltage magnitude set point. The voltage regulators collectively adjust the average voltage of the microgrid at the rated voltage. The voltage regulators allow different set points for different bus voltages and, thus, account for the line impedance effects. Moreover, the reactive power regulators adjust the voltage to achieve proportional reactive load sharing. The third module, the active power regulator, compares the local normalized active power of each inverter with its neighbors' and uses the difference to update the frequency and, accordingly, the phase angle of that inverter. The global dynamic model of the microgrid, including distribution grid, regulator modules, and the communication network, is derived, and controller design guidelines are provided. Steady-state performance analysis shows that the proposed controller can accurately handle the global voltage regulation and - roportional load sharing. An AC microgrid prototype is set up, where the controller performance, plug-and-play capability, and resiliency to the failure in the communication links are successfully verified.},

The conventional secondary control, that adjusts the voltage set point for the local droop mechanism, is replaced by a voltage regulator and a current regulator. A noise-resilient voltage observer is introduced that uses neighbors' data to estimate the average voltage across the Microgrid.

Moreover, an interface of the simulation model with a SCADA was designed to suggest possible operational screens for both: the generator and the utility. The simulation model was designed with a synchronous generator with all cogeneration typical controls: speed, active power, voltage, reactive power and power factor. Thus, it is possible to simulate critical situations with all control modes available in a typical cogeneration plant in addition to the proposed limiter. Due to the immense number of possible combinations of circuit breakers in the grid, the proposed algorithm is based on genetic algorithms to enable a fast enough autonomous reconfiguration to avoid the outage perception by the customer.},

  abstract = {A distributed control method is proposed to handle power sharing among a cluster of dc microgrids. The hierarchical control structure of microgrids includes primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. While the load sharing among the sources within a dc microgrid is managed through primary and secondary controllers, a tertiary control level is required to provide the higher-level load sharing among microgrids within a cluster. Power transfer between microgrids enables maximum utilization of renewable sources and suppresses stress and aging of the components, which improves its reliability and availability, reduces the maintenance costs, and expands the overall lifespan of the network. The proposed control mechanism uses a cooperative approach to adjust voltage set points for individual microgrids and, accordingly, navigate the power flow among them. Loading mismatch among neighbor microgrids is used in an updating policy to adjust voltage set point and mitigate such mismatches. While the voltage adjustment policy handles the load sharing among the microgrids within each cluster, at a lower level, each microgrid carries a communication network that is in contact with the secondary control system. It is this lower-level network that propagates voltage set points across all sources within a microgrid. Load sharing and set point propagation are analytically studied for the higher- and lower-level controllers, respectively. Experimental studies on two cluster setups demonstrate excellent controller performance and validate its resiliency against converter failures and communication losses.},

Two-level hierarchical control can be used for voltage unbalance compensation. Primary level, consisting of droop control and virtual impedance, can be applied to help the positive sequence active and reactive power sharing. Secondary level is used to assist voltage unbalance compensation. However, if distribution line differences are considered, the negative sequence current cannot be well shared among DGs. In order to overcome this problem, this paper proposes a distributed negative sequence current sharing method by using a dynamic consensus algorithm (DCA). In clear contrast with the previously proposed methods, this approach does not require a dedicated central controller and the communication links are only required between neighboring DGs. The method is based on the modeling and analysis of the unbalanced system. Experimental results from an islanded MG system consisting of three 2.2 kVA inverters are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract  = {One of the main technical issues in the practical implementation of a Microgrid is the design of the proper protection scheme. The scheme must be capable to meet the basic protection requirements of selectivity, sensitivity and reliability not only in grid-connected mode but also in islanded mode of operation. Since the introduction of Microgrid concept, many researchers have introduced various new protection schemes to be incorporated in medium and low voltage Microgrids. Most of the researchers agree that the conventional protective devices usually based on overcurrent principle are inadequate to provide complete protection for Microgrids during both grid-connected and islanded mode of operation, hence new protection techniques based on other principles must be developed. The new protection schemes should be not only adaptable according to operational modes of Microgrid but also sensitive enough to detect and clear the lowest possible fault currents within Microgrid quickly ensuring minimum supply disruption to consumers. This paper briefly reviews protection issues in AC Microgrids and presents state of the art protection schemes for AC Microgrids developed and proposed so far. It also gives a critical analysis of each proposed method and categorizes the protection issues and schemes on the basis of operational modes of AC Microgrid. At the end, it has been concluded that more effort is still needed to overcome the limitations of proposed protection schemes and to improve reliability of communication system for adaptive protection schemes or provide alternate means to cope with communication failures. Moreover, protection against cyber-attacks is crucial for safe and secure operation of future Microgrids.},

As the main contribution, the proposed technique compensates for the instantaneous variations of the reference current components of DG units in the ac-side of the converters. The presented method also considers and properly addresses the dc-voltage variations in the dc-side of the interfacing system. Under the proposed control strategy, DG units are able to deliver active and reactive power to the local loads and/or the main grid in fundamental and harmonic frequencies, with a fast dynamic response and without any interruption.

To determine the size of the loads that should be shed and their appropriate locations in the power system, to maintain the system frequency within the permissible limits, this paper presents an effective adaptive control scheme. In the proposed controller, a stepwise load-shedding approach is designed in the islanded MGs to regulate the grid frequency while providing the amount of power shortage. To this achieve, it locally measures the system parameters most especially voltage and frequency signals. Thereafter, a stepwise load-shedding will take place in locations where the highest voltage drop and frequency variation are experienced. The load-shedding step changes according to certain factors such as shedding speed, location and value, and the rate of frequency change. The proposed approach eliminates the adjustable loads to return the frequency back to the desired value. Simulation results of the proposed method under different practical scenarios, when compared with the conventional PID controller, provide considerable enhancement in the power system frequency stability.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of optimal voltage and power regulation is formulated for distributed generators (DGs) in DC microgrids. It is shown that the resulting control is optimal but would require the full information of the microgrid. Relaxation of information requirement reduces the optimal control into several controls including the conventional droop control. The general setting of a DC microgrid equipped with local sensing/communication network calls for the design and implementation of a cooperative droop control that uses the available local information and coordinates voltage control in a distributed manner. The proposed cooperative droop control is shown to include other controls as special cases, its performance is superior to the conventional droop control, and it is robust with respect to uncertain changes in both distribution network and sensing/communication network. These features make the proposed control an effective scheme for operating a DC microgrid with intermittent and distributed generation.},

The back-to-back converter connection facilitates bidirectional power flow between the utility and the microgrid. These converters can operate in two different modes-one in which a fixed amount of power is drawn from the utility and the other in which the microgrid power shortfall is supplied by the utility. In the case of a fault in the utility or microgrid side, the protection system should act not only to clear the fault but also to block the back-to-back converters such that its dc bus voltage does not fall during fault. Furthermore, a converter internal mechanism prevents it from supplying high current during a fault and this complicates the operation of a protection system. To overcome this, an admittance based relay scheme is proposed, which has an inverse time characteristic based on measured admittance of the line. The proposed protection and control schemes are able to ensure reliable operation of the microgrid. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Lower-level (MG level) model accepts the dispatch requirements from upper-level and determines the optimal operation strategy of distributed generators in MGs. Their energy utilization is increased with the consideration of wind curtailment, solar curtailment and other factors such as environmental benefits. With the mutual influence and constraints between upper-level and lower-level model, MGs could accommodate the optimal dispatch of DN. To solve the bi-level model, a combination method based on self-adaptive genetic algorithm and non-linear programming is put forward.

To address this problem, in this paper we present a method of determining the optimal reserve capacity under the power exchange for frequency control (PXFC) market environment. After creating some penalty rules that take microgrid islanding into account, determining the optimal reserve capacity is formulated as an optimization problem. Microgrid islanding probability (MIP) is proposed as an index to describe the likelihood of microgrid islanding. The effectiveness of the method in terms of the operating cost is investigated using simulations, where our method and two further methods are applied to microgrids with different generation capabilities. The properties of MIP are also demonstrated by the simulations.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous polygeneration microgrids is a novel approach in addressing the needs of remote areas. These needs can include power, fuel for transportation in the form of hydrogen, potable water through desalination and space heating and cooling. This approach has been investigated technically and economically and has proved viable. Further research has taken place in the supervisory management of this topology using computational intelligence techniques like fuzzy logic, which has optimized the concept minimizing the sizes of the installed components. The optimal design of the system can meet, though, only the design principles and needs. In reality experience has shown that most autonomous power systems operate out of specifications very shortly after installation or after a couple of years new needs arise and it is not possible economic wise for the people to extend it. In these cases the microgrid would struggle to cover the increased needs and in the end fail, causing blackouts. A solution to this is partial load shedding in an intelligent manner. This paper presents a multi agent system for intelligent demand side management of the polygeneration microgrid topology which also includes grey prediction algorithms for better management. This approach can also be used for designing the optimal polygeneration microgrid for a given amount of an investment. The results show that the proposed intelligent demand side management system can address its design principles successfully and guaranty the most effective operation even in conditions near and over the limits of the design specification of the autonomous polygeneration microgrid. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Small-signal analysis of the proposed control is shown both in islanded and grid-connected mode. The proposed control scheme does not need any mode switching action.

  abstract = {Installation of many distributed generations (DGs) could be detrimental to the power quality of utility grids. Microgrids facilitate effortless installation of DGs in conventional power systems. In recent years, dc microgrids have gained popularity because dc output sources such as photovoltaic systems, fuel cells, and batteries can be interconnected without ac/dc conversion, which contributes to total system efficiency. Moreover, high-quality power can be supplied continuously when voltage sags or blackouts occur in utility grids. We had already proposed a “low-voltage bipolar-type dc microgrid” and described its configuration, operation, and control scheme, through experiments. In the experiments, we used one energy storage unit with a dc/dc converter to maintain the dc-bus voltage under intentional islanding operation. However, dc microgrids should have two or more energy storage units for system redundancy. Therefore, we modified the system by adding another energy storage unit to our experimental system. Several kinds of droop controls have been proposed for parallel operations, some of which were applied for ac or dc microgrids. If a gain-scheduling control scheme is adopted to share the storage unit outputs, the storage energy would become unbalanced. This paper therefore presents a new voltage control that combines fuzzy control with gain-scheduling techniques to accomplish both power sharing and energy management. The experimental results show that the dc distribution voltages were within 340 V ± 5{\%}, and the ratios of the stored energy were approximately equal, which implies that dc voltage regulation and stored energy balancing control can be realized simultaneously.},

  abstract = {There are two operation modes of microgrids: grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode. Normally, a microgrid will be connected to the main grid for the majority of time, i.e., operates in the grid-connected mode. In the stand-alone mode, a microgrid is isolated from the main grid; the highest priority for microgrids is to keep a reliable power supply to customers instead of economic benefits. So, the objectives and energy management strategies are different in two modes. In this paper, a novel double-layer coordinated control approach for microgrid energy management is proposed, which consists of two layers: the schedule layer and the dispatch layer. The schedule layer obtains an economic operation scheme based on forecasting data, while the dispatch layer provides power of controllable units based on real-time data. Errors between the forecasting and real-time data are resolved through coordination control of the two layers by reserving adequate active power in the schedule layer, then allocating that reserve in the dispatch layer to deal with the indeterminacy of uncontrollable units. A typical-structure microgrid is studied as an example, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed double-layer coordination control method in both grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode.},

They are commonly found in the power systems of electric ships, aircrafts, etc. The main focus of this paper is to study the stability of power converters-based dc microgrids. These high switching frequency electronics are controlled in a way as to maintain constant voltage, current, or power to the load. Due to their high bandwidth, they can be simplified as a constant power load. For this reason, a nonlinear system arises where it is no longer satisfactory to assume local stability. Methods presented in the literature will be reviewed and a method based on semidefinite programming (SDP) will be developed to simplify the stability analysis of these dc microgrids. Furthermore, a robust controller approach based on a similar SDP technique is proposed in order to guarantee and expand the stability region using energy storage.},

  abstract = {In order to address the load sharing problem in islanding microgrids, this paper proposes an enhanced distributed generation (DG) unit virtual impedance control approach. The proposed method can realize accurate regulation of DG unit equivalent impedance at both fundamental and selected harmonic frequencies. In contrast to conventional virtual impedance control methods, where only a line current feed-forward term is added to the DG voltage reference, the proposed virtual impedance at fundamental and harmonic frequencies is regulated using DG line current and point of common coupling (PCC) voltage feed-forward terms, respectively. With this modification, the impacts of mismatched physical feeder impedances are compensated. Thus, better reactive and harmonic power sharing can be realized. Additionally, this paper also demonstrates that PCC harmonic voltages can be mitigated by reducing the magnitude of DG unit equivalent harmonic impedance. Finally, in order to alleviate the computing load at DG unit local controller, this paper further exploits the band-pass capability of conventionally resonant controllers. With the implementation of proposed resonant controller, accurate power sharing and PCC harmonic voltage compensation are achieved without using any fundamental and harmonic components extractions. Experimental results from a scaled single-phase microgrid prototype are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed virtual impedance control approach.},

Lack of infinite bus, tightly coupled generation and consumption, and existence of nondispatchable intermittent renewable power sources reinforce the need for a new VVC scheme. This paper presents a new model predictive control (MPC)-based dynamic voltage and var control (VVC) scheme, which includes the dynamics of the microgrid in the VVC formulation. The MPC-based controller uses a simplified voltage prediction model to predict the voltage behavior of the system for a time horizon ahead. The advantage of this method is that it can avoid unstable voltage conditions in microgrids by prediction of the instability ahead of time. This method can also avoid voltage drops or swells in any of the phases of the system since the model can predict the voltage of each phase separately. Also, the presented method can be implemented online so it can efficiently use the time-variant reactive capabilities of the distributed generators to compensate for reactive power needs of the system. This controller is tested for different operating conditions of the microgrid and the simulation results confirm that the MPC controller successfully keeps the system stable and achieves a smooth voltage profile.},

This novel control strategy optimizes the total cost of the hybrid system (generation and reposition costs) through lifetime estimations calculated hourly for each energy storage device (the battery and hydrogen system). This control strategy links the expected lifespans of the energy sources to their generation costs, i.e., when the lifespan is low, the generation cost increases and, consequently, this energy source will start to be used less. The performance of the novel EMS, including these estimations, was tested for an isolated load located in Alora (Spain) and compared with two simpler EMSs: EMS-1, which considered fixed generation costs and lifetimes, and EMS-2, which prioritized the use of the battery. Simulation results show the appropriate behavior for the novel EMS to optimize the generation costs and the number of required elements throughout the expected lifetime of the hybrid system (25 years).},

This paper investigates the optimal coordinated operation of multiple autonomous MGs and reveals the potential technical benefit. The proposed solution identifies the optimal network topologies and allocates the critical loads (CLs) to appropriate DGs based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm with power loss and reliability considerations. The non-critical loads (NLs) are determined to be supplied by the MGs based on the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach, which effectively improves the global utilization efficiency of DGs. Through the event-driven resource reallocation across multiple cooperative MGs, the dynamic balance between the power generation and demand can be attempted. The proposed approach is verified by using the IEEE 33-bus network model and its performance and scalability are further assessed through a large-scale IEEE 300-bus network scenario. The numerical results confirm that the suggested cooperative control of multiple MGs can effectively promote the capability of secure power supply to CLs, and simultaneously improves the global utilization efficiency of DGs significantly, even without any energy storage in the network.},

In this paper, these research efforts were categorized, discussed and analyzed to evaluate where we currently stand on the migration path from the overwhelming fully AC power system to a more flexible hybrid AC/DC power system. Moreover, the impediments against more deployment of DC distribution systems and some of the proposed solutions to overcome those impediments in the literature will be discussed. One of the obstacles to increased DC system penetration is the lack of standards. This problem will be discussed, and the most recent standardization efforts will also be summarized and presented.},

Research on the organization of microgrids, control devices, functionalities and other technical aspects is presently being carried out, in order to establish a consistent technical framework to support the concept. The successful development of the microgrid concept implies the definition of a suitable regulation for its integration on distribution systems. In order to define such a regulation, the identification of costs and benefits that microgrids may bring is a crucial task. Actually, this is the basis for a discussion about the way global costs could be divided among the different agents that benefit from the development of microgrids. Among other aspects, the effect of microgrids on the reliability of the distribution network has been pointed out as an important advantage, due to the ability of isolated operation in emergency situations. This paper identifies the situations where the existence of a microgrid may reduce the interruption rate and duration and thus improve the reliability indices of the distribution network. The relevant expressions necessary to quantify the reliability are presented. An illustrative example is included, where the global influence of the microgrid in the reliability is commented. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a community microgrid with multiple ac and dc microgrids is introduced and analyzed. Individual microgrids with different frequency and voltage requirements would operate as self-controlled entities, which could also cooperate with neighboring microgrids for providing back-up operations in the community microgrid. A hierarchical coordination strategy with primary, secondary, and tertiary coordination is proposed for the economic operation of an islanded community microgrid. The hierarchical strategy is also applied to a grid-connected community microgrid and the results are discussed. The simulation results verify that the proposed hierarchical coordination strategy is an effective and efficient way for coordinating microgrid flows in an islanded community microgrid, while maintaining the rated frequency and voltage with each microgrid. The simulation results also demonstrate the economic operation of a grid-connected community microgrid in which individual microgrids operate as autonomous agents, while satisfying the community objectives.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a secondary voltage control of microgrids based on the distributed cooperative control of multi-agent systems. The proposed secondary control is fully distributed; each distributed generator only requires its own information and the information of some neighbors. The distributed structure obviates the requirements for a central controller and complex communication network which, in turn, improves the system reliability. Input-output feedback linearization is used to convert the secondary voltage control to a linear second-order tracker synchronization problem. The control parameters can be tuned to obtain a desired response speed. The effectiveness of the proposed control methodology is verified by the simulation of a microgrid test system.},
